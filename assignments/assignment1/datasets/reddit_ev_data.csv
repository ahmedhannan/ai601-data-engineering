I think it's time to update the narrative on why people buy electric vehicles,"Hey guys, I posted something similar in the Rivian group a few months back, but given I've been having a discussion about this in the comments here, I thought it could be an interesting talking point. 

&#x200B;

I drive a Rivian R1S and live in Texas, more specifically, Houston, ‚Äúoil country.‚Äù I just had my 5th person tell me how dirty the process of making electric cars, blah blah blah‚Ä¶.. so I told him:

‚ÄúLook, the ‚Äòclean energy‚Äô aspect is like 7 on the list of why I got this. I got it cause it can survive the rubicon trail and smoke a Lamborghini urus and mid level Ferrari while my kids wave to the driver in their car seats in the third row‚Ä¶. And all for under $100k‚Äù

&#x200B;

Can we all admit that, for many of us, the reason for purchasing an electric car has changed? It's no longer purchased exclusively by people who care about green energy or environmental issues. We can now purchase a vehicle that moves our kids comfortably and has the performance of an elite sports car, and way more storage.... and I charge it for less than what I filled up my first car for in the 90's. All in all, we buy them cause they're just awesome cars. Period.  

I know there are many people who just want to spew the garbage they hear on their favorite ""news"" show, but I've found changing the way I discuss it with many has at least made them silent if not changed their opinion at least slightly.... especially when they get in my car and I floor it üòâ.",vjarizpe,2024-01-17 12:25:42,839,electricvehicles

Why Electric Vehicle Registration Fees are the Wrong Solution,"* Currently: 33 states require an annual flat registration fee for electric vehicles (with other states in the process of creating them).
* This is harmful as it punishes drivers who travel fewer miles and who drive smaller more efficient vehicles.
* It can result in ridiculous discrepancies (someone who drives a Chevy Bolt 5,000 miles a year pays the same as someone who drive a Hummer EV 40,000 miles a year.  Someone who drives 15,000 miles a year in Texas with an EV pays the same as someone driving a 15mpg gas vehicle the same distance.
* I am NOT saying that EV's should pay no road tax.  The solution is one that considers either miles traveled, power consumed, or a combination.   For example:  If we took Annual mileage/(mpge/3)\*(state gas tax), then a 70mpge ford F150 lightning would pay about the same gas tax as a 23mpg 2.7 Liter V6 gas version.  A 100mpge vehicle would pay the same tax as a 33mpg gas vehicle, etc.  (The exact numbers could be adjusted, but this is just an example of something that would be significantly better than the one size fits all flat fee)

If anyone is interested, I actually made a spread sheet that shows the gas tax and EV registration fees (for all states that have them, +PA with their proposed future fees).  I include mpg equivalent you're paying gas tax to in that state based on how far you drive in a year, and include some example gas vehicles showing how many miles they'd have to travel before the gas tax they pay is equal to the EV registration fee (for example, in Texas a 2024 prius would have to go 57,000 miles in a year to pay gas tax equal to the EV registration fee)

Note: the spreadsheet is still a work in progress and I have not yet included any hybrid fees (as those are often different, but I plan to include this in the future).

Here is a screenshot of the spreadsheet in progress:  
[https://i.postimg.cc/5tTXZfxq/spreadsheet-screenshot.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/5tTXZfxq/spreadsheet-screenshot.jpg)

Notes: Most of it is alphabetical with 3 exceptions.  New Jersey at the top has the highest set EV registration fee ($250).  Texas has the highest discrepancy where EV's pay the most in proportion to gas vehicles compared to any other state) and Pennsylvania, which has no registration fee in 2024, but voted to pass one if the governor signs it into law (starting at $200, then moving to $250, then is allowed to increase every year 2027 onwards) so they'll be tied for the highest EV registration fee in 2026.  Again, I haven't included hybrids yet, and am open to suggestions.

  
EDIT:

Hey Everyone,

I have been a Tesla model y driver the last three years. My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. 

Last night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn‚Äôt up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it‚Äôs lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. 

I feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy! ",Interesting_Shift431,2025-01-31 00:01:47,3727,electricvehicles

Tesla is NOT a luxury vehicle!,"I drove a M3 for 3 years. It was a great car but let‚Äôs all be very clear here, it is NOT a luxury vehicle.

But that was happening way before everyone‚Äôs opinions changed about Musk, and seems to be mostly in line with what one would expect with greater competition the market.

The people with the bumper stickers, I imagine are also people who are fairly politically motivated, who were early adaptors of EV‚Äôs, etc. I‚Äôm not sure we can read too much into that, because it‚Äôs tiny minority, and as EV‚Äôs become more mainstream, that will not be the median buyer.

There will be buyers who are alienated, and those who are attracted, by his political activity.  Does this have a discernable net effect outside the expected trendline of market forces at work?",xmorecowbellx,2025-01-23 02:33:35,651,electricvehicles

This is especially true if you live in a colder climate. Public charging in cities and on popular routes is a nightmare with EA.

Edit: I agree that it is highly dependent on your driving distances, climate, and location, but I am saying in more general terms for the average American who drives most days and lives in an urban area.

Edit #2: I also agree that having an alternate, reliable charging plan could also replace at-home charging. EA charging does NOT fit that bill imo. Again, this would be my personal advice and is more of an encouragement to prospective buyers to be more mindful of this before buying an EV.",InterdepartmentalXxy,2023-03-08 14:32:34,916,electricvehicles

Advice from someone who bought an EV planning on only public charging.,"Don‚Äôt do it to yourself it‚Äôs not worth it. I regret this decision daily. At first I lived in a small town and I thought well maybe the charging network just hasn‚Äôt reached out here yet. Now I live in a big city and there‚Äôs still barely any good options to charge reliably. Unless your apartment complex offers a good charging option just don‚Äôt do it.

 It‚Äôs not worth the hassle. I‚Äôm constantly waiting in a line just to charge, then I wait while I charge, so for me charging at a fast charger ends up being like a 2 hour affair I have to plan for at least two times a week. This brings up the next set of advice if you‚Äôre still dead set on public charging opt for the long range version of whatever EV you want to buy so you charge less often.

The US Now Has 1 Fast EV Charging Station for Every 15 Gas Stations,,Infamous-Ad625,2024-04-19 17:54:44,731,electricvehicles
"It is not the EVs, that are lacking in the US, it's the charging which needs to be reliable.","So, I own a ICE vehicle, but often will rent EVs for road trips as road trips are just better in EVs.

Now, many people have questions about the charging and complain about the increased time on road trips with EVs.

The valid complain is the charging, I'm in my 20s and even I need to stop every 3-4 hours.

Charging reliability is where it sucks.

Recently got rented an Ioniq 6. Unable to use Tesla's supercharger network (great advantage on F150 Lightning).

Excellent car, got about 290 miles of range on highway, doing 65/70.

The problem is charging.

- An Electrify America station only had one single 350kW working out of all 4 being 350kW. Two were derated down to 70-80kW because the cables were damaged and had leaked out coolant.

- One EVGo location only had 50kW 'high speed DC fast chargers'. No, they weren't derated, that's the max speed.

- An EA station wouldn't work with the app, wouldn't work with a credit card. We tried 5 times using it, and then used the 150kW next to it. Instead of 15 mins to get to 80% on 350kW we ended up charging for 35 mins.

- Map said a Tesla Supercharger had magic docks and would work for our car. Didn't work. It was a V2 version. Doesn't work for non-Teslas.

----------------------------------------

In most of the country, there are plenty of fast charging options, except for some portions. We do need more charging locations for sure, but not that many more as people imagine.

One thing though - we don't have enough chargers for peak demands during holidays, long weekends, summer etc. More chargers at the locations might be the answer, depending on utility access.

What needs to get better is charging reliability. I have not faith in EVGo and EA to actually improve their reliability once they start the J3400 standard aka the Tesla charger system.

Even with their current chargers they are improving somewhat, but they still suck.

Ultimately, it isn't the lack of charging anymore, it's the reliability of charging that needs to improve.",Ok-Pea3414,2024-07-20 14:34:28,369,electricvehicles
You DO NOT need a huge capacity circuit to charge an EV,"Just got home from a 1300 mile road trip in our Model 3 and everything went absolutely perfectly. We pulled into our driveway on 8% battery and plugged into our usual charger, which is a mobile connector with the NEMA 6-20 adapter plugged into a 20 amp 240v circuit. That little guy was able to get us from 8 to 80% in just over 12.5 hours, exactly on time for my wife to leave for work. 

I had received quotes north of $10k to upgrade our service from the pole (it's currently aerial and would have converted to buried), new main panel, adding a subpanel to the detached garage, and then a 14-50 or hardwired charger. None of that is necessary! I know Technology Connections has a great video on the subject, but I'm going to vehemently second his statement that nearly everyone is way over specifying their charging circuits and it's leading to tons of money being wasted on electrical work. A 20 amp circuit using regular 12-2 romex from a box store (or 12-2 UF cable for burial applications, no conduit needed!) should cover just about everyone's daily usage with significant overhead for long trips.",Pull_Pin_Throw_Away,2024-04-08 12:03:12,375,electricvehicles

"Dealer trying to charge more because ""EV""","Ran into an interesting situation yesterday and wanted to see if anyone else is running into this.

My EV6 went in for it's 24 month service (tire rotation) and I picked it up yesterday.  It also had a recall they took care of.  Went to the dealer in Schaumburg, IL, which I've gone to before and have been happy with.

Note, this is not a knock on the service department, they do good work and really seem to know the car.

Basically, they have a new policy for EVs, where they are basically charging more for service, simply because ""EVs are different"".  The service advisor was honest and says he doesn't agree with it, but management is making them do it.  For example, they wanted to charge $60 for a tire rotation, vs $35 for a gas car.  I called bullshit and got them to drop the price.

One one hand I get it, maintenance and service is a big revenue stream for a dealership, and EVs are cutting into that.

On the other hand, do they think we're idiots?

EDIT:  I think some people are missing the point here.  Yes, I know I can do my own rotations.  Yes, I know they can be done cheaper or free elsewhere.  I was wanting to start a discussion to see if this was an isolated incident, or if this is a worrisome trend or charging more simply because ""EV"".  It isn't just tire rotations they are trying to charge more for, they had a whole list of ""EV maintenance items"" that was separate from the ""ICE maintenance items"".",Raiine42,2024-05-14 15:22:45,398,electricvehicles

HOA wants me to charge my EV outside the garage??,"I made a last-minute decision to buy a Tesla Model 3 to take advantage of the tax incentives that expired Apr 18. Very happy with the purchase, but I do live in a townhouse (in California) with a 2-car garage I share with my neighbor, meaning that the garage is technically considered common area. 

I submitted an architectural change request to the HOA so I can install an outlet in my side of the garage and charge the car there. This outlet would only be connected to my breaker panel (with a 30A breaker) and the job would be done by a licensed electrician. I explicitly stated in my proposal that I would be responsible for all costs and that safety would be top priority. Last thing I want is to be responsible for a fire!

To my surprise, the board members are expressing quite a lot of concern regarding the fire hazard of charging an EV in the garage. One of them is pushing for the idea of installing the outlet outside the garage and having me charge in the driveway (seems quite unnecessary to me and frankly defeats the whole purpose of me choosing to live in a home with a garage to keep my car safe in). Another board member would rather have me run an outdoor conduit for the wiring from my main breaker switch (outside the building) to keep wiring hazard outside the building. They also brought up how EVs ‚Äúcatch fire frequently and the fires are hard to put out‚Äù. Next they want to meet with my electrician to discuss their concerns.

I understand wanting to keep things safe for the community, but don‚Äôt these concerns seem a bit excessive? EVs are everywhere these days, people constantly charge in garages, and I don‚Äôt see massive class-action lawsuits/recalls for fire issues. Given how slow at responding the HOA is, I‚Äôm worried this might be a months-long deal and that I might end up with a bad charging setup instead of a simple outlet-wire-breaker job. I'm well aware California is very protective towards homeowners with its ‚Äúright to charge‚Äù.

Things I‚Äôve ‚Äúlearned‚Äù about my Tesla from people who don‚Äôt own one,"1. The batteries need replaced every 100,000 miles
2. It takes hours to charge, making travel away from home nearly impossible 
3. If you get in an accident the batteries catch on fire and insurance does NOT cover them
4. Building a Tesla creates more pollution than would ever be offset vs buying an ICE car
5. The only way to charge at home is to get a special charger installed
6. Unless you have a very new home your electrical system can‚Äôt support EV charging
7. Charging actually costs more than gas
8. You can‚Äôt go over 100mph, because electric motors can‚Äôt generate enough power to overcome the air resistance
9. They randomly crash on their own
10. The government is tracking you all the time",armystrongmd,2022-07-20 16:08:38,3676,teslamotors
